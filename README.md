# Hi there! 🙋‍♂️
![capa_linkedin](images/foto_de_capa_linkedin.jpeg)
👨‍💻 Glad to meet you! I'm **José Vinícius Tavares**, a 24-year-old **Data Scientist** and **Business Analyst** from São Paulo, Brazil. I hold a degree in **Chemical Engineering** from the **University of São Paulo (USP)** and currently work as a **Business Analyst** at **Itaú Unibanco**, where I focus on modeling customer service strategies and leveraging data to drive business decisions.

My passion lies in **Machine Learning**, especially **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and I'm constantly exploring new ways to apply data science to solve real-world problems. I recently earned a **Bronze Medal 🥉** at the **27th Itaú Data Battle**, a testament to my skills and dedication in the field.
